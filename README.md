# PenguinScrolls: A User-Aligned Fine-Grained Benchmark for Long-Context Language Model Evaluation

PenguinScrolls (***‰ºÅÈπÖÂç∑ËΩ¥***) is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the long-text processing capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Current benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models often rely on synthetic tasks that fail to  adequately reflect real user needs, leading to a weak correlation between benchmark scores and actual user perceptions of model performance. To bridge this gap,  we conducted an in-depth investigation into the requirements of user groups that rely on long-text processing, gaining a thorough understanding of their demands. 
Building on these insights, we established a multi-level task classification framework oriented toward real user needs. Centered around this classification framework, we created PenguinScrolls, a comprehensive long-text dataset that encompasses a broad spectrum of document lengths, types, and interaction modes, including both single-turn and multi-turn exchanges.

Overall, the PenguinScrolls dataset encompasses four top-level categories of tasks‚ÄîInformation Extraction (420 items), Information Localization (278 items), Qualitative Analysis (305 items), and Numerical Reasoning (313 items)‚Äîamounting to a total of 1,316 single-turn data instances. 



## Key Characteristics

* **Fine-grained Task Types**: Features multi-level tasks of varying difficulty, constructing a comprehensive task classification system rooted in long-context processing abilities;
* **Multi-turn Dialogue Data**: Incorporates human-simulated questioning to create authentic long-context multi-turn dialogue scenarios;
* **Document Diversity**: Includes a wide range of natural long-form texts, including books, financial reports, legal documents, and academic papers, with contexts extending up to 128K tokens.
